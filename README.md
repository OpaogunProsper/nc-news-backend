## Environment Variables

1. Create two `.env` files in the project root folder: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. 

2. Add the following line to each file, replacing "your_database_name" with the correct database name:

    PGDATABASE=your_database_name

3. Ensure that these files are added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing sensitive and private information.
